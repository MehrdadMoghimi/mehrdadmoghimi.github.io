I am currently a forth year PhD student of Applied Mathematics at York University under supervision of [Professor Hyejin Ku](https://hku.info.yorku.ca/). Previously, I was a quantitative researcher at [Risklab Middle East](https://risklab.me/), where I had the great pleasure of working with [Professor Hamidreza Arian](https://arian.ai/). I also have a BSc in Computer Science and an MBA in Finance, both from Sharif University of Technology.

I am generally interested in Reinforcment Learning and its applications. My main areas of research include:
* Risk-sensitive RL
* Distributional RL
* Application of RL in Finance
* Applications of RL for reasoning in LLMs

## Publications:
* Beyond CVaR: Leveraging Static Spectral Risk Measures for Enhanced Decision-Making in Distributional Reinforcement Learning (ICML 2025,  [arXiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02087))
* Encoded Value-at-Risk: A Predictive Machine for Financial Risk Management (Mathematics and Computers in Simulation 2022, [rXiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06742))
