I am currently a first year PhD student of Applied Mathematics at York University under supervision of [Professor Hyejin Ku](https://hku.info.yorku.ca/). Previously, I was a quantitative researcher at [Risklab Middle East](https://risklab.me/), where I had the great pleasure of working with [Professor Hamidreza Arian](https://arian.ai/). I also have a BSc in Computer Science and an MBA in Finance, both from Sharif University of Technology.

I am generally interested in applications of machine learning in Finance. My main areas of research include,
* Risk-sensitive Reinforcement learning
* Robust Optimization

## Publications:
* Encoded Value-at-Risk: A Predictive Machine for Financial Risk Management ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06742))
